climate gru model
using to predict temp of climate with gru model,having 2 versions,one has direction,another don't has it
i make a pure gru model that don;t has directions,using this as forecast model,convert it to 2 files,

pure_gru_model is a gru train model,using it to trainning model and save,it have a save format,example:model.save,

gru_model_deploy is gru load model,using it to load trained gru model,and use the model to predict forecast climate temp data,

i draw the picture to view, and the effection is pretty good,i'm proud of neural network's extremally power,gru perfectly fit the temp trend,
it's a good rnn model

finally i saved my binary model in the file named keras_model,this is the model file with model_self and model weights,so you can simplelly launch
this model from this folder.
just do this steps:
import dependencies,
load_model,
done!
